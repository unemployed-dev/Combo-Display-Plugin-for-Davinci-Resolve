# Combo-Display-Plugin-for-Davinci-Resolve
Reads filenames to automatically generate and insert instruction images onto recorded clips, or allows combos to be typed in the editor.

Demo: https://youtu.be/uTljc4M065A

Script and accompanying folder are placed in the Scripts\Comp directory of davinci resolve. Run the plugin from davinci's script menu to begin inserting combos.
For combos to be found in file or clip names, notation must come after the characters "cc,". For example, "My cool combo cc,2hp 236hp.mp4".
If nothing appears, no combo was found.

Resolve is very buggy and there is little or no documentation for many parts, this actually took quite awhile...
